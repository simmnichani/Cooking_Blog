                place for interviews.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">After winning five out of six possible gold medals in the Artistic Gymnastics World Championship last week, US gymnast Simone Biles has set a new record – the gymnast who’s won the most medals ever. Last week’s competition in Stuttgart, Germany
                was organized by FIG, the international group in charge of the sport of gymnastics. Ms. Biles, 22, easily led the competition, taking first in beam, vault, floor routine, as well as all-around and team medals. On the bars, Ms. Biles came
                in fifth.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">US gymnast Simone Biles has been nicknamed the GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) after performing two never-before-seen moves this week. After becoming the first gymnast to ever attempt and successfully land a double-twisting, double-somersault
                dismount from the balance beam, she took things to new heights during her floor routine at the US Gymnastics Championships in Kansas City, Missouri. Biles, 22, who has won four Olympic gold medals, became the first woman to ever land a
                triple-double (two flips and three twists) in competition. Not only did she nail the landing, she made the extremely difficult move look effortless.</p>
